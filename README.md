# adventofai

Advent of Code AI. Like [AlphaCode](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/competitive-programming-with-alphacode) but significantly worse.

### Installation

I have a lot of cursed scripts, roughly, you want to install the requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`), put `OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR KEY>` in `.env`, then run `main.py`.

### TODO

- [ ] Setup benchmarking pipeline with all past adventofcode problems
  - [x] Download past aoc problems
  - [ ] Obtain working solutions to test against
  - [ ] Setup docker to run AI generated solution code
- [ ] Get a single successful automated solution
- [ ] Get >10% success rate on past problems
- [ ] Get >50% success rate on past problems
- [ ] Implement auto-submit and steal first place!
- [ ] Get >90% success rate on past problems (speculative!)
